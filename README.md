# CapStone Project 1
As of July 20, 2020
- current python code has 10 car, (1 page), limit per unique zip code in the US.
  + There is a parameter that can adjust the number of unique cars from each zip code,
       but given the time frame for presenting This is the choice that makes amount of sense.
  + Reminder: valid zipcodes are uniqu 5-digit numbers,(technically 7-digit), for the site that 
       I'm scraping from it doesn't like 7-digit zipcodes for some entries.
  + current code produces 11k results every 4 hours.
      -About 2750 every hour.
  + data collected: 
      - zipcode, year, make/model, price, milage,alloy wheels, Bluetooth, Back-up camera, certified pre-owned, remote start, leather seats, sunroof/moonroof, appearance package, transmision type, color
